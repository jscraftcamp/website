I would like to register for JS CraftCamp. 
[ ] My Pull Request contains a json file `$firstname_$lastname.json` or `$nickname.json`    
[ ] The json file follows the template at https://github.com/jscraftcamp/website/blob/master/participants/_template.json and contains the mandatory fields `name`, `tags`, `when`, `what_is_my_connection_to_javascript` and `what_can_i_contribute_to_js_craftcamp`    
[ ] If I can't attend, I will either send another Pull Request removing my json file or an E-Mail with the subject 'UNREGISTER' to team@jscraftcamp.org
