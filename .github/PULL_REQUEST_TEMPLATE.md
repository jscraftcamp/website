I would like to register for JS CraftCamp.
- [ ] My Pull Request contains a json file `$firstname_$lastname.json` or `$nickname.json`
- [ ] The json file follows the template at https://github.com/jscraftcamp/website/blob/master/participants/_template.json and contains the mandatory fields `name`, `tags`, `when` and `what_is_my_connection_to_javascript`
- [ ] If I can't attend, I will either send another Pull Request removing my json file or an E-Mail with the subject 'UNREGISTER' to team@jscraftcamp.org
