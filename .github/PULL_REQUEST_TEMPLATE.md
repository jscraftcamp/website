I would like to register for JS CraftCamp.

- [ ] My pull request contains a JSON file `$name_or_nickname.json`
- [ ] The JSON file follows the template at [https://github.com/jscraftcamp/website/blob/main/participants/\_template.json](https://jscraftcamp.org/register/) and contains the mandatory fields like `name`, `when`, `whatIsMyConnectionToJavascript` and `whatCanIContribute`
- [ ] If I can NOT attend, I will either send another pull request removing my JSON file or an e-mail with the subject 'UNREGISTER' to team@jscraftcamp.org
- [ ] I agree that the data I enter in the registration can be used for running the event, e.g. make a name tag, count me as participant. I acknowledge that my data are public on GitHub and I agree that I will be listed on the JSCraftCamp website as a participant.
- [ ] I agree that photos and videos might be taken and published (e.g. on social media) during the event.
- [ ] I understand that I might NOT get a T-Shirt, because they might be in production already
- [ ] I asked my company about sponsoring (see open items at: https://github.com/orgs/jscraftcamp/projects/5/views/1)

Are you from a sponsoring company?

- [ ] Yes, I am from company ?????
