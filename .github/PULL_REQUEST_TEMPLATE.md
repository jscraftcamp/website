I would like to register for JS CraftCamp.    
- [ ] My Pull Request contains a json file `$firstname_$lastname.json` or `$nickname.json`    
- [ ] The json file follows the template at https://github.com/jscraftcamp/website/blob/master/participants/_template.json and contains the mandatory fields `name`, `when`, `what_is_my_connection_to_javascript` and `what_can_i_contribute`    
- [ ] If I can't attend, I will either send another Pull Request removing my json file or an E-Mail with the subject 'UNREGISTER' to team@jscraftcamp.org
- [ ] I agree that the data I enter in the registration can be used for running the event, e.g. make a name tag, count me as participant. I acknowledge that my data are public on github.
