  "what_can_i_contribute": "I thrive working in teams which talk to its users every day and ship features to production even more often for a product that has impact and purpose. Do you want to get there? I can help you. I simply love bringing tech stacks to the next level, automate things and constantly improve velocity, resilience and versatility. I am the person in the team driving adoption of TDD, DDD, User Stories, Metrics, Retrospectives, Lean, Kanban. I love to code, but I will go deep on understanding why a line of code needs to exist. I have a background in CS and design, worked as a freelancer, consultant and am constantly learning, sharing and mentoring. Feel free to pick my brain about programming (web, backend, APIs, Node.js, JavaScript, AWS, ...), software craft (Testing, Quality, Releasing), career advice, leadership and agile methodologies.",
