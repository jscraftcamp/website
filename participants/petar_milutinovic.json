Worked with most of the frameworks / libraries etc out there (even dojo long time ago, god forbid), rode hype trains multiple times, now settled down on being basic (ES6 and up) and getting stuff done without getting focused on CV development. Simple code, simple solutions, easy to read is my moto.",
