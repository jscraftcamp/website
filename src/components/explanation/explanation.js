        your eyes about an 'undefined' is not a function error? We will discuss

        A barcamp – also called an unconference – is an event without any
        previously fixed agenda. All the participants meet in the morning and
        decide about the schedule for the day. Everyone can offer a session -
        from a short hands-on workshop to moderating a discussion. The goal is
        to make everything as participative as possible. Read more about BarCamp
        on Wikipedia.
