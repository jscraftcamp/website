Registration
============

### Create a JSON File and submit it via a GitHub Pull Request

To register for JSCraftCamp you have to add a json file with your name and some other information to our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jscraftcamp/website) via a [Pull Request](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14680711/how-to-do-a-github-pull-request). 

Registration is free of charge. 

Your json file should follow the naming scheme `$firstname_$lastname.json` and must be placed in the folder `participants`. The structure of the file is described below:

To test if your json file is a valid registration you can run `npm test` (more details about this are in the [README](https://github.com/jscraftcamp/website/blob/master/README.md)). Invalid registrations will be rejected.  
If you need any help with registration, don't hesitate to contact one of [the team](./theteam).

Out of these files a page with information about [all participants](/participants) will be generated.

To unregister please write another pull request or [let us know](mailto:team@jscraftcamp.org).
