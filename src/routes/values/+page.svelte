		<p>
			We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless
			of gender, sexual orientation, programming language, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status,
			and religion (or lack thereof).
		</p>

		<p>
			We believe in people and our guests - so we ask nothing more of everybody than to be
			respectful and friendly with one another.
		</p>

		<p>
			And so we invite all those who participate in the JSCraftCamp and the community surrounding
			the conference to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you have any questions or problems regarding this Code of Conduct, don't hesitate to
			contact one of us from the team.
