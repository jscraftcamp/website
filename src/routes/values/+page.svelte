	<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
	<InfoBox title="Why">
		<p>
			The JSCC community is committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
			all. Our goal is that everyone feels comfortable and welcome.
		</p>
		<p>
			And so we invite all those who participate in the JSCraftCamp and the community surrounding
			the conference to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.
		</p>
		<p>We do not tolerate discrimination, including sexism, racism, ableism.</p>
	</InfoBox>
	<InfoBox title="Do">
		<p>
			We believe in people and our guests - so we ask nothing more of everybody than to be
			respectful and friendly with one another. That means:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Treat all attendees as equals. We&#39;re all human. Don&#39;t talk down to others, don&#39;t
				harass them because they don&#39;t share your views. Assume the person standing next to you
				is at least as capable as you are.
			</li>
			<li>
				Be welcoming, friendly and patient. Treat everyone you meet like you want to be treated. Ask
				questions before jumping to conclusions.
			</li>
			<li>
				Be professional and respectful. Disagreements are for learning, not for degrading others or
				proving a point. If you notice that you&#39;re getting in a heated argument, please take a
				step back, reflect on what is being said and work with sending messages that start with
				&quot;I believe/think/see&quot;.
			</li>
			<li>
				Be aware of the effect your words may have on others. You may hate Framework X with a
				passion, the person next to you might love it. You don&#39;t own the truth. Make it clear
				that you&#39;re stating your own opinion instead of (accidentally) insulting half the room
				or making someone feel unwelcome.
			</li>
			<li>
				We encourage you to use inclusive language whenever you can. Avoid words like
				&quot;guys&quot;, use &quot;folks&quot; or &quot;friends&quot; instead. If someone tells you
				that a term you used is exclusionary, don&#39;t feel bad. Fix it next time and think about
				doing a session on it.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</InfoBox>
	<InfoBox title="Don't">
		<p>
			The following is an incomplete list of unacceptable behaviour. Violating this will definitely
			lead to consequences.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Harrass, intimidate or threaten anyone.</li>
			<li>Use sexualized language and content.</li>
			<li>Make unwanted sexual advances. Assume it&#39;s unwanted as a default.</li>
			<li>Insult or put down other participants.</li>
			<li>Joke about any of the above.</li>
		</ul>
	</InfoBox>
	<InfoBox title="Help Needed">
		<p>
			Accept feedback gracefully, if someone tells you something was not okay. Take it as a learning
			opportunity, do not automatically get defensive.
		</p>
		<p>If someone violates this CoC in your presence, please:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Tell them to stop, if you safely can.</li>
			<li>Contact any of of us from the team.</li>
			<li>Either via e-mail to: team@jscraftcamp.org</li>
			<li>Find us on-site: We&#39;ll wear special name tags.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			We (the orga team) will talk to both sides and will do the following things if appropriate:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Talk to the violating person about their behaviour.</li>
			<li>Exclude the person from the event.</li>
			<li>Contact authorities, if appropriate.</li>
		</ul>
