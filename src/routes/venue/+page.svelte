			<p>
				There are two elevators you can use: One connecting the ground level with the event area and
				a second one connecting the two event floors (this one will be reserved for people with
				walking disabilities). The front door does not open automatically.
			</p>
			<p>
				The carpet (where there is carpet) is short enough to drive on using a wheelchair. There is
				a wheelchair-accessible toilet on the fourth floor of the building; if you plan to come and
				use it, please contact us in advance so we can make sure it's open.
			</p>
			<p>The elevator has buttons with raised print numbers, no Braille.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, none of the Orga team speak sign language with any fluency.</p>
			<p>
				If you want to bring someone to help you translate or navigate the space, they do not have
				to register.

		<InfoBox title="Getting fresh air">
			There is at least one balcony you can get to for a breath of fresh air (or smoke) if you need
			one.
