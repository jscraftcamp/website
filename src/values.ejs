      We invite all those who participate in the JSCraftCamp and the community surrounding
      the conference to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong class="blue-text">Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.</strong></li>
      <li><strong class="blue-text">Be respectful</strong>.
        Not all of us will agree with each other all the time, but disagreement
        is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience
        some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to
        turn into a personal attack.
      </li>
      <li><strong class="blue-text">Be aware of the effect your words may have on others</strong>.
        We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally.
        Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants.
        Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable.
      </li>
    </ul>
