        We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual

        We believe in people and our guests - so we ask nothing more of everybody than to be <strong>respectful</strong>
        and <strong>friendly</strong> with one another.

      <p class="block">
        And so we invite all those who participate in the JSCraftCamp and the community surrounding the conference to
        help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.
